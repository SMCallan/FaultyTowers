# FaultyTowers

The title of this code is a reference to a British comedy show called Faulty Towers. Starring Monty Python's own 
John Cleese, excuse me if you already knew the reference!

This application is design to help you understand how different parts of a program can work together!

Typically we may want to use what we know about Object O Programming (OOP) and in so doing, create individual files, and modules as we have seen.

However, for ease of understanding, and to give your fingers a rest I have presented it all in one file.
